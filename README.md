# Game-theory-Dominant-Strategy-detection

+ Language: Python3
+ Input file format: NFG

+ Utility is a flat list here. Hence the values to compare are found by finding what is the step_size i.e. how much do we need to skip
+ We find dominant strategies for each player. If all have a single dominant strategy then a strongly dominant equilibrium exists, otherwise a weakly dominant equilibrium exists given by all combinations of individual dominant strategies.
